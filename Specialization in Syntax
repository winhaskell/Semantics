Specialization in Syntax

MIT Linguistics first rose to fame as the home of Noam Chomskyâ€™s revolutionary approach to syntax, beginning in the late 1950s. 
The approach to syntax that characterizes work here, now and in the past, views language as a window into the working of the
human mind. Human beings regularly demonstrate understanding of properties of their languages which, when stated precisely,
turn out to be remarkably complex; moreover, they are able to do this without relevant instruction, and (in many cases) without
variation among speakers. Research in syntax seeks to understand this complexity, and to uncover the simpler laws that underlie it. 
The Area of Specialization program in syntax provides a background in syntactic research that is both broad and deep. 
Its goal is not only to teach what is known, but to intrigue students with what remains unknown, to help them advance the field 
by solving its unsolved problems and uncovering new ones.
