 Welcome to the Formal Systems Laboratory (FSL) of the Department of Computer Science 
 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). FSL was founded in 2002 by Grigore Rosu, 
 when he joined UIUC (from NASA Ames). In the FSL, we design and develop

foundational and theoretical models,
specification and programming languages, techniques and methodologies, as well as
software analysis prototypes and tools,
all aiming at increasing the quality of computing systems.

Current Research Areas 
>> Programming Language Design and Semantics
>> Runtime Verification
>> Behavioral Specification
