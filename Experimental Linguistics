Specialization in Experimental Linguistics
A central agenda for the scientific study of language is the effort to understand

how language is represented in the mind/brain as a system of knowledge that all human beings hold in common;
how it is subject to developmental growth throughout childhood; and
how its deployment as a computational ability in real time language use relies on and is constrained by other cognitive systems.
Pursuing these questions requires a blend of quantitative experimental and computational approaches, combined with theoretical 
interest and expertise.

The experimental linguistics track within the Linguistics PhD is dedicated to the formation of scientists who are equally
at home in these areas. They can creatively combine traditional linguistic, experimental and computational approaches to 
the study of language and its interfaces with other systems of the mind and so play a truly integrative role within cognitive science.
