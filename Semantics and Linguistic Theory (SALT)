SALT 28
Semantics and Linguistic Theory (SALT) is the premier North American conference on semantics as a part of linguistic theory. 
The 28th SALT will take place on May 18-20, 2018 in the Stata Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. 
Our invited speakers are Amy Rose Deal and Benjamin Spector. By attending, you agree to abide by the code of conduct. 

SALT 28 is organized by faculty at MIT (Kai von Fintel, Danny Fox, Martin Hackl, Irene Heim, Sabine Iatridou, Justin Khoo, and 
Roger Schwarzschild) with the help of many student volunteers. As usual for SALT, the organizers also served as the program committee.
