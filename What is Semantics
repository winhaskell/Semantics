What is Semantics

Explanation: This document is an attempt to make an arcane and not very well understood area of inquiry intelligible to
someone who knows no logic or linguistics. It was originally written for an encyclopedia that wanted something accessible 
even to a pre-high-school audience. But it doesn't appear in any encyclopedia, because I wasn't willing to write something
to the editors' specifications, and they weren't willing to change their specifications. This episode is yet another example
of how bad a job semanticists have done of making even well-informed laymen aware of what the issues are in the field.

Semantics is the study of the meaning of linguistic expressions. The language can be a natural language, such as English or
Navajo, or an artificial language, like a computer programming language. Meaning in natural languages is mainly studied by
linguists. In fact, semantics is one of the main branches of contemporary linguistics. Theoretical computer scientists and
logicians think about artificial languages. In some areas of computer science, these divisions are crossed. In machine translation, 
for instance, computer scientists may want to relate natural language texts to abstract representations of their meanings; to do this,
they have to design artificial languages for representing meanings.
