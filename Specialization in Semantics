Specialization in Semantics

The goal of semantic theory is to give a precise characterization of the meanings expressible in natural language 
and of how they are encoded in syntactic structure. Philosophers and logicians have been concerned with these 
questions since antiquity, and analytical philosophy of the past two centuries has pursued them with unprecedented 
vigor and success. In the course of the last few decades, this research tradition has been taken over by linguists. 
With the rapid progress of generative linguistics, it became increasingly inappropriate to theorize about the relation
between meaning and structure on the basis of lay conceptions of grammar instead of building on the results of the
scientific study of syntax. Today, it is no longer possible to work on the cutting edge of semantic research without
a solid background in both linguistics and philosophical logic. The conceptual and formal apparatus that was developed 
when semantics was the domain of philosophers remains as indispensible as ever, and it must be employed in conjunction
with up- to-date knowledge of syntactic theory and its growing basis of cross- linguistic empirical evidence. 
The area of specialization program in semantics is designed to offer this kind of training.
