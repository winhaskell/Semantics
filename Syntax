Syntax of the Logic Programming language Prolog

Introduction
The syntax of Prolog is deceptively simple. The User inputs a series of predicates 
that have three different meanings - facts to be stored, goals to be searched for(queries), 
or commands(directives) which do one thing. There is also a special kind of rule called a clause 
which defines conditions underwhich a fact can be true.
