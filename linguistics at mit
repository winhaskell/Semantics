About the MIT Linguistics Program
The MIT Linguistics Group has been engaged in the study of language since the 1950’s, and the first class of PhD students 
was admitted in 1961. Our research aims to discover the rules and representations underlying the structure of particular 
languages and what they reveal about the general principles that determine the form and development of language in the
individual and the species. The program covers the traditional subfields of linguistics (phonetics, phonology, morphology, 
syntax, semantics, and psycholinguistics) as well as interfaces with philosophy and logic, speech science and technology, 
computer science and artificial intelligence, and study of the brain and cognition.
